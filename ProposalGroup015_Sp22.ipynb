        "Our goal of the project is to find the best method l to predict the readmission rates of diabetes patients in US by comparing different 4 classification methods learned in class. The data that we will use represents 10 years (1999–2008) of clinical care at 130 hospitals and integrated delivery networks throughout the United States. It contains over 50 attributes such as patient number, race, gender, and age, etc. and classification labels: >30(readmitted after 30 days), <30 (readmitted within 30 days), and no (no readmission). We will first split the data into the training set and the testing set. Then we are going to select a range of attributes and use them to predict the readmission rates via ML methods such as SoftMax regression, multi-class SVM, KNN, and decision tree/random forest. The performance of our models will be measured by evaluating the rates of Type 1 and Type 2 errors."

The high readmission rates of diabetes patients bring heavy burden to the medical systems in the US.\n",

        "The U.S has a problem of access to health care<a name=\"ander\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#ander). The number of health care professional required to service the aging population is greater than the number of well-trained medical professionals being supplied. Rural areas are especially vulnerable to not having many qualified doctors and nurses<a name=\"ziller\"></a>[<sup>[5]</sup>](#ziller). Our goal of this project is improving patient outcomes by exploring the accuracy of 4 machine learning models in predicting readmission rate of patients using historic data collected over 10 years. Most hospitals keep a clinical history for every patient admitted which in rural areas can be used as input to an efficient machine learning algorithm to predict staffing and funding needs. Our project seeks to use features found in such clinical histories to label a patient into each of the 3 readmission categories. For any given time interval of a hospital, a \"future prediction set\" can be put through the algorithm with best performance to label each patient. Taking the count of each of the patients in the predcition set labeled as needing readmission, the readmission rate in the following 30 days can be computed."

Since SVM does not support multi-class classification naturally, we can break down our problem to multipale binary classification problems. Since we have 3 classes, we will train 3 SVMs and each SVM predicts the membership of that sample in one of the classes. Regarding implementation details, we can use sklearn.svm.SVC(), where we will try to use different kernels: ‘linear’, ‘poly’, ‘rbf’ and use cross validation to select the best kernel.\n",
